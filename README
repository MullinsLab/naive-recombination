NAME
    recombine-naively - Naively recombine input sequences at specified
    breakpoints

SYNOPSIS
        recombine-naively --breakpoint=N [--breakpoint=N] [file.fasta ...]
        recombine-naively --help

DESCRIPTION
    Produces naive recombinant sequences (hard breaks, no mutation) from all
    possible combinations of input sequences.

    Input and output is in the FASTA format.

    If no input files are provided, stdin is read. Output is always to
    stdout.

    Output sequences are named in the following manner:

        foo|@113|bar|@242|baz

    where "foo", "bar", and "baz" are the input sequence names and 113 and
    242 are the breakpoint locations between the adjacent sequences.

OPTIONS
    --breakpoint=N
    -b N    Specify a breakpoint should occur *after* position N. Positions
            are 1-based.

            This option may be repeated to add multiple breakpoints. N may
            also be a comma-separated list of positions.

            The number of breakpoints may not exceed the number of sequences
            and breakpoint positions must fall within the length of the
            shortest sequence.

    --help  Show this help.

INSTALLATION
    Currently the only supported way is using cpanm:

        cpanm --installdeps .

    This will install the dependencies for everyone on the system and then
    you can run this program. You can also install dependencies in a local/
    directory just for you:

        cpanm --installdeps -L local .

    Alternatively, you can install the dependencies in cpanfile manually
    with the standard cpan command. This is equivalent to installing
    system-wide with cpanm.
